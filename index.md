<div class="lede">A month-long no-stress hackathon. Share what you're working on, get free &#128077;'s.</div>

Octobuild is a project board where you can post what you're working on this October, and see cool projects other people are working on. Think of it like a long hackathon, virtual and remote, with no judges, no prizes, no pressure, and no competition. It's just letting other developers know what you're working on so you can see, share, collaborate, and be inspired.

## Get notified next October

[Sign up here](http://eepurl.com/3O-JL). We'll let you know when next the Octobuild is about to start!

## If you want to read more

The idea is that we make a list of projects we're working on in October that we're proud of. That's it. Huge passion projects, random stuff from work, fiddle projects from Saturday afternoons, non-code projects that have a home online, or that chapter of the book you've been writing for years.

Just saying you're working on a project and telling others, we've found, is monumentally helpful towards getting it done. There is actually a named phenomenon for this, called [the Hawthorne effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect). So tell us what you're working on. This is just for October - like [NaNoWriMo](http://nanowrimo.org/), having a timeline helps. Unlike that, no one is keeping score, and finishing is optional.

During the Octobuild season, we check up with you to ask how you've done, and post a list of finished projects or work done. We also send out semi-weekly reminders to work on your project. At the end of the month, we stop taking PRs and freeze it until next year, when it will begin again.
