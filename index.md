# Octobuild

<div class="lede">A month-long no-stress hackathon. Share what you're working on, get free &#128077;'s.</div>

Octobuild is a project board where you can post what you're working on this October, and see cool projects other people are working on. Think of it like a long hackathon, virtual and remote, with no judges, no prizes, no pressure, and no competition. It's just letting other developers know what you're working on so you can see, share, collaborate, and be inspired.

## Join!

Post your project as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/RichardLitt/octobuild/issues/new). Once one of us mark it as a project, it'll appear here automagically.

## Projects:

<div id="projects" class="current-projects"></div>

### If you want email updates sometimes

[Sign up here](http://eepurl.com/3O-JL). We'll check up with you at the end of October to ask how you've done, and post a list of finished projects or work done. We'll also send out semi-weekly reminders to work on your project.

### If you want to read more

The idea is that we make a list of projects we're working on in October that we're proud of. That's it. Huge passion projects, random struff from work, fiddle projects from Saturday afternoons, non-code projects that have a home online, or that chapter of the book you've been writing for years.

Just saying you're working on a project and telling others, we've found, is monumentally helpful towards **getting it done**. There is actually a named phenomenon for this, called [the Hawthorne effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect). So tell us what you're working on. This is just for October - like [NaNoWriMo](http://nanowrimo.org/), having a timeline helps. Unlike that, no one is keeping score, and finishing is optional.

At the end of the month, we'll stop taking PRs and freeze it until next year, when it will begin again.

I've given myself until the end of October to get it up to an MVP. Let's see if the Hawthorne Effect can keep me going.

### Why GitHub?

Because it is a great place to store this because it's a tool we use every day; it is easy to add to; it has a history of being used for [awesome lists](https://github.com/bayandin/awesome-awesomeness); it allows for easy hosting of this website.

This list is on [octobuild.com](http://octobuild.com). If you're coming off of GitHub, we'll try and mirror the master and gh-pages branches; submit PRs to either, preferablly gh-pages.

### Who?

*Disclaimer:* Octobuild is in no way affiliated with GitHub's Octocat, although this is hosted on GitHub Pages and we think GitHub is awesome.
