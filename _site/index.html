<h2>What</h2>

<p>A month-long no stress hackathon. Tell us what you&#39;re working on, get free &#128077;&#39;s.</p>

<p>Octobuild is a project board where you can post what you&#39;re working on this October, and see cool projects other people are working on. Think of it like a month-long hackathon, virtual and remote, with no judges, no prizes, no pressure, and no competition. It&#39;s just letting other developers know what you&#39;re working on so you can see, share, collaborate, and be inspired.</p>

<h2>Participate</h2>

<p>Post your project as a <a href="https://github.com/RichardLitt/octobuild/issues/new">GitHub issue</a>.</p>

<p>Once one of us mark it as a project it&#39;ll appear here automagically.</p>

<h2>Last year&#39;s participants:</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pauldessert/SeedTip">SeedTip</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/pauldessert">PaulDessert</a>. <em>A fun little side project I&#39;m working on to learn the Google Map API.</em></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bcseda/codexer">codexer</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/brandonseda">BrandonSeda</a>. <em>I&#39;m building an ePub authoring app</em></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jaredbeck/graph_matching">GraphMatching</a> by <a href="http://www.jaredbeck.com/">Jared Beck</a>. <em>Maximum cardinality and minimum weighted matchings in undirected graphs.</em></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/RichardLitt/octobuild">Octobuild</a> by <a href="https://github.com/RichardLitt">RichardLitt</a>. <em>I am building this thing.</em></li>
<li><strong>The Wabi-Sabi of Programming</strong> by <a href="http://twitter.com/simonv3">@simonv3</a>. <em>I&#39;m looking into Wabi-Sabi, and what principles we can take away from it and apply to our programming.</em></li>
<li><a href="http://zombie-floss.herokuapp.com">Zombie Floss</a>, my ever-evolving Rails App to accompany <em>The ~~Zombie~~ Open Source Survival Guide</em>, by <a href="https://github.com/JaimeLynSchatz">JaimeLynSchatz</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://secret-inlet-5715.herokuapp.com/">FML, or Fix My List</a>, also by <a href="https://github.com/JaimeLynSchatz">JaimeLynSchatz</a> was orginally my entry for the <a href="http://railsrumble.com/">Rails Rumble hackathon</a>, but it was incomplete. I&#39;ve given myself until the end of October to get it up to an MVP. Let&#39;s see if the Hawthorne Effect can keep me going.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ariera/i19">I19</a> by <a href="https://github.com/ariera/">ariera</a>. <em>I am building a tool to help me smooth the development of Rails apps with i18n support</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>If you want email updates sometimes</h2>

<p><a href="http://eepurl.com/3O-JL">Sign up here</a>. We&#39;ll check up with you at the end of October to ask how you&#39;ve done, and post a list of finished projects or work done. We&#39;ll also send out semi-weekly reminders to work on your project.</p>

<h2>If you want to read more</h2>

<p>The idea is that we make a list of projects we&#39;re working on in October that we&#39;re proud of. That&#39;s it. Huge passion projects, random struff from work, fiddle projects from Saturday afternoons, non-code projects that have a home online, or that chapter of the book you&#39;ve been writing for years.</p>

<p>Just saying you&#39;re working on a project and telling others, we&#39;ve found, is monumentally helpful towards <strong>getting it done</strong>. There is actually a named phenomenon for this, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect">the Hawthorne effect</a>. So tell us what you&#39;re working on. This is just for October - like <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a>, having a timeline helps. Unlike that, no one is keeping score, and finishing is optional.</p>

<p>At the end of the month, we&#39;ll stop taking PRs and freeze it until next year, when it will begin again.</p>

<h2>Why GitHub?</h2>

<p>Because it is a great place to store this because it&#39;s a tool we use every day; it is easy to add to; it has a history of being used for <a href="https://github.com/bayandin/awesome-awesomeness">awesome lists</a>; it allows for easy hosting of this website.</p>

<p>This list is on <a href="http://octobuild.com">octobuild.com</a>. If you&#39;re coming off of GitHub, we&#39;ll try and mirror the master and gh-pages branches; submit PRs to either, preferablly gh-pages.</p>
